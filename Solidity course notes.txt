Stuff to read about:

NatSpec (sort of Java documentations)
Doxygen (NatSpec was inspired byb Doxygen)
solc (command that auto-generates documentation based on NatSpec)
Storage - check out github @ PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc   /contracts/exampleContracts/FunWithStorage.sol and /deploy/99-deploy-storage-fun.js; pay extra attention to understanding arrays and mappings (do some examples to better understand them)
Hardhat network reference >>> http://hardhat.org/hardhat-networkk/reference/
callstatic
Better understand what network.provider is



Other notes:

In order to show your LINK wallet in your Metamask account, you go to Chainlink docs -> LINK Token Contracts -> <your_prefered_network> (in my case Rinkeby) and copy address -> in Metamask go to Assets -> Import tokens and copy the address in here; 
this is the long way, as the Chainlink docs has an "Add to wallet" option now that does all the copying for you (added this long way for future reference)
